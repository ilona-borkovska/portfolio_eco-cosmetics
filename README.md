<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>The landing page is structured using the BEM methodology, which stands for Block, Element, Modifier. This methodology is a way of organizing CSS code that makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain.</p>

<p>The landing page consists of several different blocks, including the header, navigation section, about our brand section, shop section, about the creators section, contacts and footer.</p>

<p>To ensure consistent code formatting, the landing page also utilizes Stylelint, a CSS linter that checks your code for syntax errors and style violations.</p>
